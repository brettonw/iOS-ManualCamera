iOS-ManualCamera
=======================

ManualCamera is the GitHub project for OmegaCam, the last camera.

I love my iPhone camera for all sorts of uses, but there are a ton of times where I want manual control of the exposure, focus, or color balance - so a manual camera is needed. I also have some ideas for photography that nobody else is doing (all the stock apps use iOS built-in functionality as near as I can tell), and this will be my platform for doing it. 

This project started with using undocumented APIs in iOS7, and the impetus for that was some measurement work I was doing that required solid control of the camera. That need diminished with iOS8 and the manual camera APIs, though I do still find there is a degree of variability in the meaning of an exposure setting I would like to solve eventually.

Feel free to use ManualCamera sources as an educational means to understand how the Apple APIs control:

* Exposure (time)
* ISO (film speed)
* Color balance
* Focus
